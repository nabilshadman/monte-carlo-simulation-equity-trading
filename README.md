# 1. Monte Carlo Simulation in Trading
Application of **monte carlo** simulation in trading. This is an ongoing project.  

**Tech Stack:** Python (scipy, numpy, matplotlib).  


# 2. Notebooks
In this section, we describe the **notebooks** of the project.  

**lognormal_distribution.ipynb**  
This notebook discusses lognormal distribution.  

**pareto_distribution.ipynb**  
This notebook discusses pareto distribution.  

**simulating_equity_prices.ipynb**  
This notebook simulates equity prices.  

**simulating_trading_volume.ipynb**  
This notebook simulates trading volume.  


# 3. Environment
We recommend installing **Anaconda Distribution** before running the notebooks as Anaconda provides a powerful package management system called Conda, which can handle complex software environments and ensures compatibility between different packages. Conda simplifies the setup process and avoids version conflicts.  

(1) Download Anaconda Distribution from this [page](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and run the installer.  

(2) Once installation is finished, launch Anaconda Navigator, which provides a graphical user interface to manage your Anaconda environment.  

(3) In Anaconda Navigator, you should see a button labeled "Launch" under the Jupyter Notebook section. Click on it to start Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.  

(4) Navigate to the directory of this project on your system. 


# 4. Execution  
In this section, we describe the steps to **run** the notebooks.
